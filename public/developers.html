    <h1>How do I register as a developer?</h1>
    <p>In order to submit applications to the store, you need to register as a developer. Registration is free and can be done <a href="register.html">here</a>.</p>
    <br />
    <h1>What resources are available to me?</h1>
    <p>The store allows installed applications to access its TOR connectivity so they too can increase the privacy of network connections they make. Documentation for this is provided <a href="documents/developer_manual.pdf">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Additionally, developers can combine this TOR connectivity with a HTTP library developed by the store team to connect to backend services securely. Documentation for this is provided <a href="documents/developer_manual.pdf">here</a>.</p>
